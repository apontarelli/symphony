# Symphony Elixir

This directory contains the current Elixir/OTP implementation of Symphony, based on
[`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) at the repository root.

> [!WARNING]
> Symphony Elixir is prototype software intended for evaluation only and is presented as-is.
> We recommend implementing your own hardened version based on `SPEC.md`.

## How it works

1. Polls Linear for candidate work
2. Creates a workspace per issue
3. Launches Codex in [App Server mode](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server/) inside the
   workspace
4. Sends a workflow prompt to Codex
5. Keeps Codex working on the issue until the work is done

During app-server sessions, Symphony also serves a client-side `linear_graphql` tool so that repo
skills can make raw Linear GraphQL calls.

If a claimed issue moves to a terminal state (`Done`, `Closed`, `Cancelled`, or `Duplicate`),
Symphony stops the active agent for that issue and cleans up matching workspaces.

If Codex reports that operator input, approval, or MCP elicitation is required, Symphony keeps the
issue claimed and exposes it as blocked in the runtime state, JSON API, and dashboard. Blocked
entries are in memory only; restarting the orchestrator clears that blocked map, so any still-active
Linear issue can become a dispatch candidate again after restart.

## How to use it

1. Make sure your codebase is set up to work well with agents: see
   [Harness engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/).
2. Get a new personal token in Linear via Settings → Security & access → Personal API keys, and
   set it as the `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. Commit a thin `symphony.yml` in the target repo. The manifest selects Symphony-owned workflow
   modules and records repo-specific facts such as docs entry points, VCS posture, delivery target,
   and narrow runtime overrides.
4. Run `symphony workflow check` from the target repo root to validate the manifest and resolved
   module metadata before starting the daemon.
5. When creating a workflow based on this repo, note that it depends on non-standard Linear issue
   statuses: "Rework", "Human Review", and "Merging". You can customize them in Team Settings →
   Workflow in Linear.
6. Follow the instructions below to install the required runtime dependencies and start the service.

## Prerequisites

We recommend using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage Elixir/Erlang versions.

```bash
mise install
mise exec -- elixir --version
```

## Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/symphony
cd symphony/elixir
mise trust
mise install
mise exec -- mix setup
mise exec -- mix build
SYMPHONY_BIN="$PWD/bin/symphony"
cd /path/to/target-repo
"$SYMPHONY_BIN" workflow check
"$SYMPHONY_BIN" --i-understand-that-this-will-be-running-without-the-usual-guardrails
```

## Configuration

Target repositories author `symphony.yml`. The manifest stays intentionally thin:

```yaml
version: 1
project:
  name: Example App
  app_kind: web
workflow:
  preset: core
  modules:
    - core_delivery
docs:
  entrypoints:
    - README.md
    - AGENTS.md
vcs:
  mode: jj
delivery:
  pr_target: main
runtime:
  tracker:
    project_slug: "linear-project-slug"
  workspace:
    root: ~/code/symphony-workspaces
  hooks:
    after_create: |
      git clone git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git .
```

Run the check command from the target repo root:

```bash
symphony workflow check
```

`workflow check` resolves the selected modules, validates docs entry points, compiles runtime config,
and prints resolved module metadata plus a deterministic policy hash.

Optional flags:

- `--logs-root` tells Symphony to write logs under a different directory (default: `./log`)
- `--port` also starts the Phoenix observability service (default: disabled)

Legacy `WORKFLOW.md` files remain supported as an explicit runtime/export compatibility path. They
are not the default target-repo authoring contract and should not be copied into new target repos.

Notes:

- If a value is missing, defaults are used.
- `tracker.required_labels` is optional. When set, an issue must have every
  configured label to dispatch or continue running. Label matching ignores
  case and surrounding whitespace. A blank configured label matches no issue.
- Safer Codex defaults are used when policy fields are omitted:
  - `codex.approval_policy` defaults to `{"reject":{"sandbox_approval":true,"rules":true,"mcp_elicitations":true}}`
  - `codex.thread_sandbox` defaults to `workspace-write`
  - `codex.turn_sandbox_policy` defaults to a `workspaceWrite` policy rooted at the current issue workspace
- Supported `codex.approval_policy` values depend on the targeted Codex app-server version. In the current local Codex schema, string values include `untrusted`, `on-failure`, `on-request`, and `never`, and object-form `reject` is also supported.
- Supported `codex.thread_sandbox` values: `read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`.
- When `codex.turn_sandbox_policy` is set explicitly, Symphony passes the map through to Codex
  unchanged. Compatibility then depends on the targeted Codex app-server version rather than local
  Symphony validation.
- Workflows that run package managers or other commands that resolve external hosts should set
  `networkAccess: true` in `codex.turn_sandbox_policy`; otherwise DNS/network access may be denied
  by the Codex turn sandbox.
- `agent.max_turns` caps how many back-to-back Codex turns Symphony will run in a single agent
  invocation when a turn completes normally but the issue is still in an active state. Default: `20`.
- Selected modules must compile a non-empty prompt. Legacy `WORKFLOW.md` files with a blank
  Markdown body use a default prompt template that includes the issue identifier, title, and body.
- Use `hooks.after_create` to bootstrap a fresh workspace. For a Git-backed repo, you can run
  `git clone ... .` there, along with any other setup commands you need.
- If a hook needs `mise exec` inside a freshly cloned workspace, trust the repo config and fetch
  the project dependencies in `hooks.after_create` before invoking `mise` later from other hooks.
- `tracker.api_key` reads from `LINEAR_API_KEY` when unset or when value is `$LINEAR_API_KEY`.
- For path values, `~` is expanded to the home directory.
- For env-backed path values, use `$VAR`. `workspace.root` resolves `$VAR` before path handling,
  while `codex.command` stays a shell command string and any `$VAR` expansion there happens in the
  launched shell.

- If the selected workflow source is missing or has invalid YAML at startup, Symphony does not boot.
- If a later reload fails, Symphony keeps running with the last known good workflow and logs the
  reload error until the file is fixed.
- `server.port` or CLI `--port` enables the optional Phoenix LiveView dashboard and JSON API at
  `/`, `/api/v1/state`, `/api/v1/<issue_identifier>`, and `/api/v1/refresh`.

## Web dashboard

The observability UI now runs on a minimal Phoenix stack:

- LiveView for the dashboard at `/`
- JSON API for operational debugging under `/api/v1/*`
- Bandit as the HTTP server
- Phoenix dependency static assets for the LiveView client bootstrap
- Tracker issue identifiers link to the tracker-provided URL when it uses `http` or `https`

## Project Layout

- `lib/`: application code and Mix tasks
- `priv/workflow_modules/`: Symphony-owned workflow module source files used by the compiler
- `test/`: ExUnit coverage for runtime behavior
- `../symphony.yml`: the Symphony repo's own target-repo manifest for dogfooding
- `WORKFLOW.md`: legacy compatibility workflow kept for explicit runtime/export use
- `../.codex/`: repository-local Codex skills and setup helpers

## Testing

```bash
make all
```

Run the real external end-to-end test only when you want Symphony to create disposable Linear
resources and launch a real `codex app-server` session:

```bash
cd elixir
export LINEAR_API_KEY=...
make e2e
```

Optional environment variables:

- `SYMPHONY_LIVE_LINEAR_TEAM_KEY` defaults to `SYME2E`
- `SYMPHONY_LIVE_SSH_WORKER_HOSTS` uses those SSH hosts when set, as a comma-separated list

`make e2e` runs two live scenarios:
- one with a local worker
- one with SSH workers

If `SYMPHONY_LIVE_SSH_WORKER_HOSTS` is unset, the SSH scenario uses `docker compose` to start two
disposable SSH workers on `localhost:<port>`. The live test generates a temporary SSH keypair,
mounts the host `~/.codex/auth.json` into each worker, verifies that Symphony can talk to them
over real SSH, then runs the same orchestration flow against those worker addresses. This keeps
the transport representative without depending on long-lived external machines.

Set `SYMPHONY_LIVE_SSH_WORKER_HOSTS` if you want `make e2e` to target real SSH hosts instead.

The live test creates a temporary Linear project and issue, writes an isolated runtime workflow
fixture, runs a real agent turn, verifies the workspace side effect, requires Codex to comment on and
close the Linear issue, then marks the project completed so the run remains visible in Linear.

## FAQ

### Why Elixir?

Elixir is built on Erlang/BEAM/OTP, which is great for supervising long-running processes. It has an
active ecosystem of tools and libraries. It also supports hot code reloading without stopping
actively running subagents, which is very useful during development.

### What's the easiest way to set this up for my own codebase?

Launch `codex` in your repo, give it the URL to the Symphony repo, and ask it to set things up for
you.
